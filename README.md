A work in progress. This application recreates the class game Yahtzee. I created everything, from the user interface to the game logic and AI player you can play against. It was created using JavaScript, Node, Express, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.



THINGS TO FIX / IMPROVE: 

Stop rolling when the computer has taken a score

Fix when to go for 3k/4k, when to choose which

Recognizing large straights

Computer not taking a 0 for 4k

Add instructions modals at very beginning

Add up the scores at the end and have a winner's screen

Player can't choose a category when it's not player's turn 

Players scores (bottom half) not working right, especially when you don't have the correct roll

Computer took a 0 for 4 when it had 2 4s (shouldve gotten an 8)

Players scoring for 3k, 4k, and small straight (counts them even when you don't get them)
